        <h2>Who am I?</h2>
        <p id="bio">A <span class="focus">software developer</span> based in Milan with particular focus on <span class="focus">blockchain</span> and machine learning technologies. 
          <br>
          My background is in aerospace engineering at Politecnico di Milano centered on complex aerospace structures. Did you ever ask yourself why a rocket is able
          to not explode during the launch? Or how an aircraft is able to fly even in turbulent conditions? I studied these topics.
          <br>
          After the academy, fascinated by the results in computer vision and generative models, I started studying coding and <span class="focus">data-driven models</span>. I achieved 
          some certifications in these fields mainly on the Coursera platform.
          <br>
          At the start of 2021, thanks to some techy friends, I ended up deepening the blockchain technology. Now, I spend most of my time 
          delving into blockchain coding and protocol analysis.
          <br>
          I currently write articles on Medium related to <span class="focus">decentralized finance</span> trying to help improving distributed technologies knowledge.
          <br>
          Technology apart, I'm a second dan judo black belt that loves spending spare time playing padel with friends and reading books.

        <h2>Articles</h2>
        <p>
          I like sharing what I learn during the day in a form of Medium post. Maybe, in a future, I will move to Notion as it allows for an easier and 
          better looking formatting, who knows. In the meantime, you can find articles I wrote on my Medium profile.
